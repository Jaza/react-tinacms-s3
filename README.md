# _react-tinacms-s3_

This package provides helpers for managing TinaCMS media in **Amazon S3**.

This is just for trying out installing it, until https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/1838 gets merged into TinaCMS proper. Need a separate repo, because it's too hard to npm install or yarn install one package from a monorepo, directly from a branch in GitHub.
